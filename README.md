# CRM-cli


Testing your API can be done in multiple ways. Beside unit and integrated testing, writing a CLI which can act as a front-end for your API can be a great tool to test API's functionality.
In this project, I tried to write a simple Command Line Interface to mimic my front-end for the previous CRMs.
